I want to create a presentation about blockchain and cryptocurrency fundamentals for beginners with a maximum of 5 slides. The presentation should cover: 1. Introduction to Blockchain - what it is and why it's revolutionary 2. How Blockchain Works - basic concepts like blocks, chains, and decentralization 3. Cryptocurrency Basics - Bitcoin, digital wallets, and how crypto transactions work 4. Real-world applications beyond crypto - supply chain, healthcare, voting systems 5. Getting started with blockchain - popular platforms, wallets, and learning resources. The presentation should be educational, engaging, and suitable for people with no prior blockchain or cryptocurrency experience. Focus on practical understanding and clear explanations rather than complex technical details.
